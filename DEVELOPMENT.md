## Technical Architecture

### Component Hierarchy

```
App.tsx (Main Game Component)
├── Camera (react-native-vision-camera)
├── Game UI Overlay
│   ├── Header (Title)
│   ├── Status Container
│   │   ├── Instructions/Game Info
│   │   └── Timer & Eye Status
│   ├── Distraction Effects
│   └── Controls (Start Button)
└── Permission Handling
```

### State Management

```typescript
interface GameState {
  isPlaying: boolean;
  score: number;
  currentTime: number;
  bestTime: number;
  roundStarted: boolean;
}

interface BlinkData {
  leftEyeOpen: boolean;
  rightEyeOpen: boolean;
  lastBlinkTime: number;
}
```

### Key Algorithms

#### Blink Detection (Current: Simulation)

```typescript
// Simplified simulation for development
const simulatedBlink = Math.random() < 0.05; // 5% chance per frame
```

#### Future: Real EAR Implementation

```typescript
// Eye Aspect Ratio calculation
const EAR = (vertical1 + vertical2) / (2.0 * horizontal);
const isBlinking = EAR < THRESHOLD; // ~0.25
```

#### Distraction Timing

```typescript
// Random delays between 2-5 seconds
const delay = Math.random() * 3000 + 2000;
```

## Development Environment

### Required Dependencies

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "react-native-vision-camera": "^3.x.x",
    "@react-native-ml-kit/face-detection": "^7.x.x",
    "react-native-reanimated": "^3.x.x",
    "react-native-permissions": "^3.x.x",
    "lottie-react-native": "^6.x.x",
    "react-native-sound": "^0.11.x"
  }
}
```

### Platform Configuration

#### Android Setup
- Minimum SDK: 21
- Target SDK: 33
- Permissions in AndroidManifest.xml
- Camera2 API support

#### iOS Setup
- Minimum iOS: 11.0
- Camera usage description in Info.plist
- CocoaPods integration

### Performance Considerations

1. **Frame Processing**
   - Limit to 30fps for face detection
   - Use worklets for UI thread performance
   - Debounce blink detection

2. **Memory Management**
   - Properly dispose of camera resources
   - Clean up timers and intervals
   - Optimize image processing

3. **Battery Optimization**
   - Pause detection when app is backgrounded
   - Reduce processing during game over state
   - Use efficient animation libraries

## Testing Strategy

### Manual Testing Checklist

- [ ] Camera permission flow
- [ ] Face detection accuracy in various lighting
- [ ] Game timer accuracy
- [ ] Distraction timing and effects
- [ ] UI responsiveness
- [ ] Memory leaks during extended play
- [ ] Performance on low-end devices

### Automated Testing

```typescript
// Example test structure
describe('BlinkDetectionEngine', () => {
  it('should detect blinks correctly', () => {
    // Test EAR calculation
  });
  
  it('should handle consecutive frames', () => {
    // Test temporal filtering
  });
});
```

## Known Issues & Limitations

1. **Face Detection Library**
   - Current implementation uses simulation
   - Real ML Kit integration needs platform-specific setup
   - Performance varies across devices

2. **Camera Performance**
   - High battery usage during gameplay
   - May need frame rate limiting
   - Hot device in extended sessions

3. **Lighting Sensitivity**
   - Poor performance in low light
   - Need better fallback mechanisms
   - Could add light detection warning

## Future Enhancements

### Short Term (v1.1)
- Real face detection implementation
- Audio feedback integration
- Performance optimization
- Better error handling

### Medium Term (v1.5)
- Machine learning model improvement
- Multiplayer features
- Cloud leaderboards
- Achievement system

### Long Term (v2.0)
- AR/VR integration
- Advanced distractions (3D effects)
- Biometric integration
- Social gaming features

## Deployment Notes

### Release Build Optimization

```bash
# Android
cd android
./gradlew assembleRelease

# iOS
cd ios
xcodebuild -workspace DontBlinkGame.xcworkspace -scheme DontBlinkGame -configuration Release
```
